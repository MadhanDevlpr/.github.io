                        I'm Madhan Aadithya, a Front-end Developer and a Pythonista, studying in 9th Grade,
                        I started my programming journey with Python and made numerous projects.
                        And atlast I started using a web framework called Flask to develop websites, the next step for me was to learn HTML and CSS,
                        I learnt Css for styling the Html but I wasn't satisfied with my work, I just created Static websites but now in the recent past I've learnt javascript and learnt to create Dynamic websites.
                        I've also learnt Bootstrap for making some lightweight projects.
